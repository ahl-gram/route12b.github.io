Over the past few years, about 70 alumni have ventured out to launch 30+ startups, covering AI safety, search, robotics, edtech, climate tech, enterprise tools... You name it.\r\n\r\nSome examples:\r\n\r\n* Anthropic (natch) (Dario and Daniela Amodei and John Schulman) - tackling next‑gen safety challenges.\r\n* Safe Superintelligence (Ilya Sutskever) - also tackling safety challenges.\r\n* Perplexity (Aravind Srinivas) - AI‑powered search.\r\n* Thinking Machines Lab (Mira Murati) - “customizable” AI.\r\n* Cleanlab (Anish Athalye), Symbiote AI (Taehoon Kim) and Aidence (Tim Salimans) - basically a grab bag of applications for AI: data‑quality tooling to real‑time 3D avatars to medical imaging.\r\n* Several more, such as Covariant, Prosper Robotics, Living Carbon, Daedalus, Eureka Labs , Pilot, Cresta, and Adept AI Labs.\r\n\r\nEssentially, OpenAI’s blend of mission‑driven R&D, a collaborative culture, and early exposure to bleeding edge models is effectively acting as a de facto incubator. No formal accelerator needed.\r\n\r\nThe “OpenAI Mafia” is a real thing, and its ripple effects are definitely being felt. Watching these founders go from colleagues to competitors is pretty exciting. And frankly tough to keep up with. But it's cool to watch it all unfold.\r\n\r\nSources:\r\n[techcrunch.com/2025/04/2...](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/26/the-openai-mafia-15-of-the-most-notable-startups-founded-by-alumni/)\r\n[analyticsindiamag.com/global-te...](https://analyticsindiamag.com/global-tech/the-openai-mafia-just-got-bigger/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/chatgpt-image-may-5-2025-08-19-22-am.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"\">\n",

In contrast, user prompts are the dynamic, moment to moment instructions we give, ephemeral and ever changing.\n\nSystem prompts are the result of extensive R&D investment. They codify competitive advantage, encapsulate proprietary business logic, and increasingly represent a company’s core intellectual property.\n\nSo it’s not surprising that system prompts have become valuable targets. We’ve already seen system prompt leaks from ChatGPT and Claude. Additionally, Cursor’s system prompt was leaked, revealing its internal instructions. And Perplexity AI’s system prompt was exposed through prompt injection techniques. \n\nFor AI companies, protecting these prompts will require not just better technical defenses but also new legal frameworks specifically addressing the theft of prompt designs.\n\nFor users, this is a reminder: AI models aren’t neutral or purely spontaneous. Every impressive output you see is shaped by a deliberately engineered system prompt, an invisible layer that’s becoming one of the most valuable assets in the AI industry.\n\nSources:\n\n[www.nebuly.com/blog/llm-...](https://www.nebuly.com/blog/llm-system-prompt-vs-user-prompt)\n\n[www.geeky-gadgets.com/cursor-sy...](https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/cursor-system-prompt-leak/)\n\n[www.reddit.com/r/PromptE...](https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1k1aaj2/full_leaked_devin_ai_system_prompts_and_tools_100/?rdt=61677)\n\n[dev.to/paka/reve...](https://dev.to/paka/reverse-engineering-perplexity-ai-prompt-injection-tricks-to-reveal-its-system-prompts-and-speed-secrets-16ce)\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/0b61f54477.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n",

This was in the early days of online learning. If there was Pluralsight or LinkedIn Learning (née Lynda Learning) around, I certainly wasn’t aware of them at the time. But I had a Mac and there was plenty of documentation online detailing how to create your own app. At the time, Swift didn’t exist. It was all Objective-C, which I objectively hated. I’m not blaming the language or framework. Rather, I lacked the patience and wherewithal to truly immerse myself in it.

I was built of weaker stuff.</p>\n<p>Which brings us to the current moment: AI coding agents. Of course I had used Copilot in VS Code and had heard of the benefits of IDEs like Cursor, but nothing really drove me to try it all out. That is until past-me was smart enough to attend a tech talk at work introducing us all on how to leverage an agent to generate code for you at the project level.</p>\n<p>I’m not talking about going into ChatGPT and asking it to create a function to sort some integers, or parse a date.

It felt like cheating. Alot. I don’t know a lick of SwiftUI and I am not up on the latest iOS design specs and best practices. On the other hand, I also knew that life is short.

				"content_html": "<p>🎂 🎂 🎂 Here we are: the big 5-oh. I asked ChatGPT to create a light but heartfelt post for me, but all I got out of that exercise was generic and saccharine outputs about how “50 is the new 30” (news to me), and how I’m looking forward to new adventures… blah blah blah. Plus, way too many birthday cake emojis.</p>\n<p>Despite the milestone, it’s true that I’m feeling upbeat. I’m grateful for my beautiful family and life’s blessings. But the general tone of the ChatGPT responses - shockingly - reeked of AI. So I’m going to have to do this the hard way: write this post myself without the help of an AI assistant. Like an animal.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with some perspective. Here’s some fun and interesting things that happened by the close of 1974:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Nixon resigned as US president.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Rubik’s Cube was invented.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 closed at 68.56.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Dow closed at 616.24.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I was born.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s a funny line in “A Christmas Story” where Ralphie describes the feeling of time running out as “the Christmas noose beginning to tighten”. Turning 50 is kind of like that. My “time-left-to-do-stuff&quot; noose is beginning to tighten. Wait, that sounded darker than I intended. What I’m trying to say is that it’s a weird feeling knowing that I’m now older than my father was when I, as a kid, first realized he was OLD.</p>\n<p>This being the age of electronic communication, I had a whole conversation with my extended family - over text - about how 50 is middle age (again, news to me).

				"content_text": "🎂 🎂 🎂 Here we are: the big 5-oh. I asked ChatGPT to create a light but heartfelt post for me, but all I got out of that exercise was generic and saccharine outputs about how “50 is the new 30” (news to me), and how I’m looking forward to new adventures… blah blah blah. Plus, way too many birthday cake emojis.\r\n\r\nDespite the milestone, it’s true that I’m feeling upbeat. I’m grateful for my beautiful family and life’s blessings. But the general tone of the ChatGPT responses - shockingly - reeked of AI. So I’m going to have to do this the hard way: write this post myself without the help of an AI assistant. Like an animal. \r\n\r\nLet’s start with some perspective. Here’s some fun and interesting things that happened by the close of 1974:\r\n\r\n* Nixon resigned as US president.\r\n\r\n* Rubik’s Cube was invented.\r\n\r\n* The S&P 500 closed at 68.56.\r\n\r\n* The Dow closed at 616.24.\r\n\r\n* I was born.\r\n\r\nThere’s a funny line in “A Christmas Story” where Ralphie describes the feeling of time running out as “the Christmas noose beginning to tighten”. Turning 50 is kind of like that. My “time-left-to-do-stuff\" noose is beginning to tighten. Wait, that sounded darker than I intended. What I’m trying to say is that it’s a weird feeling knowing that I’m now older than my father was when I, as a kid, first realized he was OLD.\r\n\r\nThis being the age of electronic communication, I had a whole conversation with my extended family - over text - about how 50 is middle age (again, news to me). This is ridiculous given that the average lifespan in the US is around 80. The actuaries would say I’m well past middle-age. But I think the sentiment with my family was more complex than merely taking my expected lifespan and dividing it by two. Most of us, regardless of what the calendar says, feel like we’re perpetually in middle age. We’re constantly “adulting”: managing family, job, our homes, hobbies, our health, and unexpected life events.\r\n\r\nSome of these unexpected life events can permanently change your perspective on your life. My wife’s cancer journey really drove that point home for me: Life is short. Yeah, no kidding. My advice: don’t just sit on your ass too long. Thing’s aren’t as good or as bad as you think.\r\n\r\nBill Burr said it best: “You’re gonna be fine. And even if you’re not, isn’t it better to exist thinking it’s going to be fine until it’s not? And then, you can handle it then. There’s no sense in ruining right now.”\r\n\r\nIndeed. Enjoy right now. So, here’s to the next actuarially-adjusted 50 years. \r\n\r\nCheers and salud.\n",

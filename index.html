			 <p>I&rsquo;ve noticed a concerning trend: many &ldquo;educational&rdquo; videos and articles seem more focused on riding the AI hype wave than providing actual value. The creator&rsquo;s understanding often seems surface-level at best. Especially on sites like YouTube, the videos seem more like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making this video to demonstrate my barely-there understanding of this stuff&rdquo; and less like &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a great step-by-step tutorial from someone who&rsquo;s mastered it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After spending hours searching for quality resources, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learned:</p>
<p>• Look for content creators who demonstrate real applications, not just theory.
• Quality tutorials include code samples and address common errors.
• The best resources explain WHY, not just HOW.
• The videos should conclude with a call to action you can take right now in your current role.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much buzz out there, people are dying to create content from it. So, here&rsquo;s some resources I&rsquo;ve found genuinely helpful:
• Tina Huang has addressed this dichotomy in a number of her videos (Agentic flow vs. actual AI agents)
• The Neuron Newsletter has also talked about this in their daily email.</p>

			 <p>Want a super simple and easy way to keep your apps and tooling up-to-date on your Mac?</p>
<p>No surprise here: use 🍺 Homebrew. Install all apps using <code>brew</code> and then use a script to upgrade both brew itself and your brew-installed apps.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a certain category of apps that aren&rsquo;t available via Homebrew. A large swath of these are only available in the Mac App Store. So, what can we do about these?</p>
<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s a brew-installable tool that allows you to work around this as well: <code>mas</code> (short for &ldquo;Mac App Store&rdquo;). <code>mas</code> allows you to script installing and upgrading these apps just like with <code>brew</code></p>
<p>Once you install <code>mas</code>, you can now install and update all of your apps and tooling from your favorite terminal (mine is Warp).</p>
<p>Also, you can use shell commands to change the color of the text output to make it easier on the eyes. Below is a script I run occasionally in order to update all of my apps on my Mac and then give me a report of all apps I have installed via <code>brew</code> or <code>mas</code>.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>P.S. Upgrading apps using <code>mas</code> is a little trickier. You have to find the Mac App Store id and then feed that to <code>mas</code> in the terminal. However, I gotchu: the script above will give you all of those ids every time. <code>mas</code> link here: <a href="https://github.com/mas-cli/mas">https://github.com/mas-cli/mas</a></p>

			 <p>Two interesting news morsels coming out of Redmond.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Microsoft is re-negotiating their partnership with OpenAI to clear a path for an OpenAI IPO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft just announced layoffs across LinkedIn(!) and GitHub, with a focus on reducing management layers and streamlining operations. It amounts to about 3% of the workforce.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, are these two news stories related in any way?</p>
<p>Microsoft has invested north of $13 billion in OpenAI. With OpenAI exploring an IPO, MS likely wants to ensure its continued access to bleeding edge AI technology.</p>
<p>Given that they reported record revenue ($62 billion) and profit in the latest quarter, the Microsoft layoffs appear targeted, because clearly there isn&rsquo;t financial distress here.</p>
<p>Freeing up headcount and budget allows Microsoft to redirect resources to AI and other growth initiatives.</p>

			 <p>About a year ago, I made a prediction: that the rise of LLMs like ChatGPT would lead to fewer programming languages over time. If AI agents can translate high-level instructions into code, then language complexity becomes an implementation detail rather than a developer concern.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, with tools like Cursor and Windsurf, and we&rsquo;re closer to that reality. For example, I can ask Cursor to “build a weather app in React with Redux” and get a runnable scaffold without touching the docs. In a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>So far, we haven’t seen any significant drop in the <em>number</em> of languages. But I think the original intuition holds: we’re moving toward a world where the choice of language matters less because the AI abstracts it away. Hence: vibe coding.</p>

			 <p>On call duty doesn’t have to be a burden. It can be quite the career accelerator in software engineering. Here&rsquo;s 4 reasons why y’all might want to embrace those midnight alerts.</p>
<p><strong>1. Deepen Your Understanding of the Entire System</strong></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re on call, you&rsquo;re exposed to parts of the system you might not interact with during your daily routine. This exposure strengthens your ability to troubleshoot effectively and contributes to a more robust system design.</p>
<p><strong>2. Enhance Cross-Functional Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Incidents often require coordination with alot of different stakeholders: product managers, customer support, devops, etc. All of this interaction sharpens your communication skills and fosters a collaborative environment, which is key for swift incident resolution.</p>
<p><strong>3. Cultivate a Mindset for Resilient Coding</strong></p>
<p>Experiencing real life fires just reinforces the importance of writing resilient, fault-tolerant code. It instills a proactive approach to anticipate potential failures. And drives home the need to design systems that can gracefully handle unexpected issues.</p>
<p><strong>4. Build Strong Partnerships with SREs</strong></p>
<p>Collaborating with site reliability engineers during incidents creates great partnerships. SREs bring specialized expertise in system reliability, monitoring, and performance optimization. By working alongside these folks during incidents, you&rsquo;ll gain insights into observability best practices and develop a shared understanding of your company’s reliability needs. These partnerships often lead to better architectural decisions long before any incident occurs.</p>
<p>So, being on call isn&rsquo;t just about responding to late night alerts, it&rsquo;s a great experience that fosters growth and resilience. It&rsquo;s an opportunity to grow as an engineer and contribute to building reliable systems at scale.</p>

			 <p>A college education is meant to shape how we think, not just what we know. At least, that’s what we’re told. The act of writing essays and solving math problems aren’t meant to be busywork. They’re exercises in critical thinking, the mental equivalent of weightlifting.</p>
<p>This is why AI tools present such a problem in higher education. A NYMag feature showed that many students now treat AI not as a learning aid but as a &ldquo;get out of jail free&rdquo; card, allowing them to cheat on just about any assignment. Short term, this seems efficient, maybe. But long term, it’s like hiring someone to do your pushups and expecting to get stronger. How will tomorrow’s college grads think critically if they didn’t master it while at university?</p>
<p>But there’s a greater issue here that predates AI cheating by several decades: college isn’t about learning anymore, it’s about high stakes. Ethan Mollick noted that the modern university experience has become transactional. Students are acutely aware that good grades can unlock internships, jobs, scholarships, etc. The system pressures students to produce results, not necessarily to understand the material.</p>
<p>If ChatGPT can generate a passable term paper in 10 minutes, and that paper gets the same grade as one that took 20 hours, any rational student weighs the costs and benefits and decides they’re better off taking the risk with ChatGPT doing the heavy lifting. When incentives reward output over process, the result isn’t surprising.</p>
<p>My take is that we can’t ban AI tools in education. That ship has sailed. Rather than resist this shift, educators, students, and parents should adapt. That adaptation will require changes in how educators assess learning. It may involve more oral exams, in-class writing assignments, or coursework that explicitly asks students to critique or build upon AI generated work. It also means educators must teach students how to use AI responsibly: as a thought partner rather than as a ghostwriter.</p>
<p>For parents, the challenge is to reinforce the value of learning over simply achieving. I have tried to practice this myself with my own kids. I know they’re going to use AI tools to help them finish their schoolwork. I just ask that they use it as a learning tool and not merely as a crutch to finish the work faster. Time will tell if this was good advice.</p>

			 <p>Just announced: Google&rsquo;s NotebookLM app is coming “May 20th on iOS and Android.” It&rsquo;s being touted as one of their best AI tools yet, offering users tons of flexibility.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with NotebookLM, it&rsquo;s essentially Google&rsquo;s answer to AI-assisted research and note taking. The tool has previously existed in a more limited form (only on the web), but this standalone app release shows Google&rsquo;s confidence in its capabilities. I particularly enjoy using NotebookLM because it understands your documents, allowing you to have conversations about your content instead of just searching through it. There’s a podcast feature as well, although I haven’t tried that bit yet.</p>
<p>My biggest use case for it so far has been with random user manuals for home appliances, tools, and other household doodads. We have a cabinet where we keep these, but have not once gone back to reference them. With NotebookLM, I can scan the manuals in as PDFs and then ask questions in chatbot form later, which decreases friction tremendously.</p>
<p>For those of us who&rsquo;ve been waiting for the app version of NotebookLM, the wait appears to be nearly over.</p>

			 <p>Recently, I was thinking about all the new AI startups that are in the news pretty much constantly. Many are founded by Open AI alumni. It turns out OpenAI isn’t just a leading AI company. It’s also become Silicon Valley’s newest “mafia,” much like the OG PayPal network. Over the past few years, about 70 alumni have ventured out to launch 30+ startups, covering AI safety, search, robotics, edtech, climate tech, enterprise tools&hellip; You name it.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anthropic (natch) (Dario and Daniela Amodei and John Schulman) - tackling next‑gen safety challenges.</li>
<li>Safe Superintelligence (Ilya Sutskever) - also tackling safety challenges.</li>
<li>Perplexity (Aravind Srinivas) - AI‑powered search.</li>
<li>Thinking Machines Lab (Mira Murati) - “customizable” AI.</li>
<li>Cleanlab (Anish Athalye), Symbiote AI (Taehoon Kim) and Aidence (Tim Salimans) - basically a grab bag of applications for AI: data‑quality tooling to real‑time 3D avatars to medical imaging.</li>
<li>Several more, such as Covariant, Prosper Robotics, Living Carbon, Daedalus, Eureka Labs , Pilot, Cresta, and Adept AI Labs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, OpenAI’s blend of mission‑driven R&amp;D, a collaborative culture, and early exposure to bleeding edge models is effectively acting as a de facto incubator. No formal accelerator needed.</p>
<p>The “OpenAI Mafia” is a real thing, and its ripple effects are definitely being felt. Watching these founders go from colleagues to competitors is pretty exciting. And frankly tough to keep up with. But it&rsquo;s cool to watch it all unfold.</p>

			 <p>Alot has already been said about this.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/01/apple-lost-but-did-epic-win">Gruber</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-claims-victory-as-apple-sanctioned-for-defying-court-order-over-app-store-rules/">9to5mac</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s Primary Technology’s podcast where Stephen and Jason spend the first <a href="https://social.primarytech.fm/c/episodes/apple-broke-the-law-i-was-deepfaked-and-even-the-beach-has-ads">35 minutes</a> on it.</p>
<p>As far as Apple itself, we’re seeing some immediate effects of this where they are changing the App Store rules to allow outside purchases, something judge Gonzalez Rogers emphasized in her <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1508.0_2.pdf">ruling</a> that was something the company was supposed to do <em>in the first place</em>.</p>
<p>But I want to talk about something a little different. After digesting this news for a day or two and listening to some podcasts about it, my main takeaway was the reaction to the <em>hugeness</em> of it. Most folks who cover Apple love their products. There&rsquo;s a genuine enjoyment in showing others how easy and fun it is to touch and feel and use iPhones, Macs, iPads, etc. The software is intuitive, beautifully designed, almost eye candy. Additionally, there&rsquo;s some joy in contrasting with other companies' products where the same design and joyfulness is decidedly <em>absent.</em></p>
<p>However, now these same people can no longer ignore the fact that Apple has behaved in a manner that is clearly anti-user, not to mention anti-developer. One commenter on 9to5mac summed it up pretty well: </p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Apple makes some of my favorite technology products, while at the same time engaging in some of the most anti-competitive, anti-consumer practices we see today. I celebrate this ruling. I believe it&rsquo;s possible both to love Apple products and want the company to do better.</em>&rdquo; - Ryan W.</p>
<p>When other Big Tech companies are naughty, that&rsquo;s big news too. And it&rsquo;s covered just as thoroughly. But the reaction is a little more muted, to my ears at least. Nowadays, in 2025, we almost <em>expect</em> Google, Meta, Amazon, et al. to misbehave from time to time. Their revenue model doesn&rsquo;t align perfectly with user experience, and so it&rsquo;s no surprise that Google wants all of our data or Meta wants to show us more targeted ads. And it&rsquo;s not really much of a shock when they&rsquo;re accused of lying and cheating the system. &ldquo;Oh, Zuck weaseled his way through that senate hearing? Cool. What&rsquo;s for lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Apple ignores a judge&rsquo;s ruling and an Apple executive is allegedly caught <em>lying under oath,</em> the subtext of the reaction is different: <em>Apple is better than this. They should have known better.</em> Indeed, Phil Schiller appealed to the other execs' better natures back when the first ruling occurred in 2021 and basically said (paraphrasing): &ldquo;guys, let&rsquo;s just do what they&rsquo;re asking and move on&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting contrast. Apple is so huge nowadays that it really shouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise that they&rsquo;re engaging in anti-competitive behavior. Just like all the others, they can afford an army of analysts and lawyers to figure out ways to game the system. What&rsquo;s different though, is when the Googles and Metas of the world do it, we seem to shrug our shoulders. But when Apple does it, we&rsquo;re genuinely hurt because our expectations of the company that was founded by Steve Jobs are much higher.</p>

			 <p>Yet again from the “life imitates Black Mirror” files is a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/ai-personal-assistant-wearable-tech-impressions-28156b57">report</a> from Joanna Stern at WSJ highlighting wearable AI devices. The Bee Pioneer captures conversations to provide summaries and reminders. The Limitless Pendant records audio to offer behavioral feedback, aiming to improve personal interactions. Finally, Plaud Note transcribes and summarizes recordings using AI, assisting with tasks like meeting notes and to-do lists. These devices record everything you say, all the time, around the clock.</p>
<p>I’m amazed at the proliferation of surveillance products designed to blend seamlessly into daily life, and our willingness to tolerate such surveillance. I experienced this firsthand when my daughter convinced my wife and me to get a pet bunny. Wanting to monitor the adorable animal while away, we installed a Google Nest camera, linking it to my daughter&rsquo;s account. During setup, she remarked, &ldquo;Sure, Google, take all of my information. Google has all of our data anyway.&rdquo; Her comment underscored our growing acceptance of constant monitoring.</p>
<p>And now, it’s not just our smartphones. Meta&rsquo;s Ray-Ban smart glasses, for instance, resemble regular eyewear but can discreetly record videos and livestream content. A recent incident involved an influencer using these glasses to film women without their consent.</p>
<p>Even before this latest report and the experience with the bunny cam, I was mildly aware that someone might record me while I was out in public. But now, I think I will have to operate under the very accute paranoia that any interaction could be recorded and shared out of context to millions. In response, counter-surveillance tools are emerging, which merely underscores society&rsquo;s ambivalence toward these advancements.</p>
<p>So where does that leave us? Swimming around in our little surveillance fishbowl, occasionally waving at the cameras we know about.</p>
<p>To be fair, I&rsquo;m not abandoning my smart devices. That ship has sailed. However, I am more discerning about what I bring into my home, and how I behave while out in public.</p>

			 <p>Two separate reports out of the Wall Street Journal detail the renaissance IBM is currently experiencing under CEO Arvind Krishna.</p>
<p>The first report details investments related to AI (natch). The second story reports on a massive investment in (wait for it) mainframe and quantum computing systems. Mainframes in 2025? Indeed.</p>
<p>First thing&rsquo;s first: Big Blue has amassed $6 billion in generative AI bookings, mostly through consulting services. Quite the remarkable turnaround story for IBM, whose software division has found new life after shedding its IT outsourcing unit Kyndryl in 2021. For a company once considered a relic of computing&rsquo;s past, this pivot represents a meaningful shot at relevance in our current AI-driven moment.</p>
<p>However, IBM&rsquo;s track record with emerging technologies should give us pause. Despite pioneering achievements like Deep Blue and Watson, the company has consistently stumbled when translating innovation into market dominance. The cloud computing revolution offers a sobering example, where IBM watched as AWS and Microsoft Azure captured the market it could have led.</p>
<p>Speaking of cloud computing, don&rsquo;t count IBM out just yet: they made quite the bold move in another area of investment. The company announced a staggering $150 billion investment in the US over the next five years, with over $30 billion earmarked specifically for R&amp;D in mainframe and quantum computing systems. Cloud computing gets all the glory, true. But the backbone of global finance, healthcare, and government operations still runs on these powerhouse mainframes. IBM&rsquo;s z-Series mainframes process 90% of all credit card transactions globally and handle core operations for 92 of the world&rsquo;s top 100 banks.</p>
<p>And in the quantum computing realm, let&rsquo;s talk about those qubits. The $30+ billion earmarked for quantum R&amp;D is pretty impressive and potentially industry-defining. While Google, Microsoft, and others have made significant quantum computing advancements, IBM&rsquo;s financial commitment here dwarfs previous investments in the space.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just about computing power, it&rsquo;s about establishing leadership in what will likely become the most transformative technology of our lifetime (including AI). When practical quantum computing arrives at scale, everything changes: drug discovery, materials science, cryptography, AI training, climate modeling, you name it. All of them revolutionized.</p>
<p>Krishna is breathing new life into IBM and recognizing AI&rsquo;s transformative potential. The company&rsquo;s stock is up, investors are taking notice, and there&rsquo;s genuine excitement about IBM for the first time in years. For longtime IBM watchers, this feels like a critical inflection point. It might either be the beginning of a true renaissance or just another false start.</p>

But I never knew that Charlie Brown was named after a <a href="https://historyfacts.com/arts-culture/fact/real-charlie-brown-real-person/">real person</a>.

			 <p>Why are AI system prompts being treated like digital gold, leaked and protected like user passwords? What’s the real difference between a system prompt and a user prompt?</p>
<p>A system prompt acts like a hidden constitution: it defines the AI’s behavior, personality, and constraints across all conversations. In contrast, user prompts are the dynamic, moment to moment instructions we give, ephemeral and ever changing.</p>
<p>System prompts are the result of extensive R&amp;D investment. They codify competitive advantage, encapsulate proprietary business logic, and increasingly represent a company’s core intellectual property.</p>
<p>So it’s not surprising that system prompts have become valuable targets. We’ve already seen system prompt leaks from ChatGPT and Claude. Additionally, Cursor’s system prompt was leaked, revealing its internal instructions. And Perplexity AI’s system prompt was exposed through prompt injection techniques.</p>
<p>For AI companies, protecting these prompts will require not just better technical defenses but also new legal frameworks specifically addressing the theft of prompt designs.</p>
<p>For users, this is a reminder: AI models aren’t neutral or purely spontaneous. Every impressive output you see is shaped by a deliberately engineered system prompt, an invisible layer that’s becoming one of the most valuable assets in the AI industry.</p>

			 <p>No fewer than three companies: Yahoo (yes, you read that right), OpenAI, and Perplexity have each been reported by The Verge as being interested in acquiring Google Chrome should the need to sell become reality.</p>
<p>The interest from these three in acquiring Chrome represents quite the convergence of business strategy and the result of the DOJ antitrust remedy. All three companies recognize Chrome’s immense value as a distribution channel and see its acquisition as a potential shortcut to challenging Google’s search dominance.</p>
<p>But each company has its own unique motivations too:</p>
<p>Yahoo is focused on boosting its search engine’s market share and sees Chrome as a means to that end.</p>
<p>OpenAI is interested in enhancing its AI models’ capabilities through better access to search data, viewing Chrome as a tool to diversify data sources (outside of Bing).</p>
<p>Perplexity aims to overcome distribution challenges posed by Google’s existing agreements and is cautious about the broader implications of such an acquisition.</p>
<p>For its part, Google has strongly opposed the potential divestiture, arguing that it would be disruptive and damage the browser’s functionality, while also maintaining plans to appeal the decision.</p>

			 <p>A top restaurant SaaS company <em>AND</em> a new color? Yes: Olo.</p>
<p>As someone building software, I find this stuff pretty cool. And this is just a bonkers coincidence. This week&rsquo;s mind-blowing <a href="https://www.popsci.com/health/new-color-green/">discovery</a> is that a team of scientists has enabled five people to see a color no human has ever seen before: a vivid, pure, almost electric blue-green dubbed “olo.”</p>
<p>This is the result of a new system called the Oz Vision System, which uses ultraprecise, eye safe lasers(!) to stimulate a very specific set of photoreceptor cells in the retina without triggering their overlapping neighbors (which natural light can NOT do).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Olo&rdquo; is more than just a pretty color. It’s proof that our brains can perceive colors outside the known visual spectrum if given the right stimulation. Test subjects couldn’t match it with any known color unless significant white light was added. It&rsquo;s basically a brand new color.</p>
<p>I also love how &ldquo;olo&rdquo; the color is pretty close to Olo&rsquo;s own branding colors. Delicious.

			 <p>Saw something interesting today about the beloved cult classic &ldquo;The Big Lebowski.&rdquo; Jeff Bridges recently revealed at an LA screening that he&rsquo;s genuinely interested in bringing The Dude back to our screens. He mentioned that Julianne Moore shares his enthusiasm, and they&rsquo;ve apparently discussed sequel possibilities.</p>
<p>But as much as Bridges would love to don that cardigan again (and who wouldn&rsquo;t want to see it?), he&rsquo;s realistic about the chances. The Coen brothers aren&rsquo;t typically sequel-minded filmmakers. Though Bridges left the door open, saying &ldquo;If they called me up and said, &lsquo;Hey let&rsquo;s do it again,&rsquo; I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Absolutely, come on.'&rdquo; That&rsquo;s about as straightforward as it gets. Far out.</p>
<p>The unsuccessful spinoff &ldquo;The Jesus Rolls&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t helped the case for revisiting this universe. John Turturro&rsquo;s attempt at a spinoff landed with a thud. Still, there&rsquo;s something comforting about knowing that 25+ years later, the cast remains so attached to these characters that they&rsquo;d jump at the chance to return. The Dude continues to abide, even if only in our collective cinematic memory.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s vibe-coding. And you may have even heard of vibe-project management: where projects are guided by a gut feeling or the overall mood of the team. Or maybe just the PM&rsquo;s feelings.</p>
<p>However, I haven&rsquo;t seen anyone explore vibe-engineering management. Is it a thing? <em>Should</em> it be a thing? Managing engineers based purely on vibes?</p>
<p>Imagine it: no metrics, no clear goals, just managing your team on vibes. Sounds great. Less paperwork, fewer awkward conversations, and tons of freedom. Sweet. I mean, who wouldn&rsquo;t want this?</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the catch: while vibe management sounds fun, relying purely on vibes can quickly spiral into chaos. Good feelings and intentions alone won&rsquo;t clarify expectations, solve conflicts, or help the team develop their skills long term. Over time, unclear goals, inconsistent feedback, and confusion can tank morale, kill productivity, and lead to burnout. Not to mention lead to bad vibes.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the better alternative? Let&rsquo;s look at some best-practices and blend them with good vibes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set clear expectations and goals (engineers love clarity).</li>
<li>Provide consistent, actionable feedback regularly, not just during annual reviews.</li>
<li>Foster psychological safety so your team can express concerns openly.</li>
<li>Balance intuition with measurable data. Trust, but verify.</li>
<li>Always ask, &ldquo;is there any way I can help you?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>So you could combine good vibes with good practices, and you’ll get the best of both worlds: a happy, motivated team that delivers exceptional results.</p>

			 <p>There’s an itch I’ve been meaning to scratch for the better part of 15 years now. And among job, family, and let’s face it, lack of motivation, I’ve never been able to get anywhere near to creating my own iOS app that I could call my own and share on the App Store. Until now.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s set the <a href="https://rockyandbullwinkle.fandom.com/wiki/WABAC_machine">WABAC machine</a> for 15 years ago: I considered myself a somewhat competent back-end developer, and I wanted to create an app but had zero experience. This was in the early days of online learning. If there was Pluralsight or LinkedIn Learning (née Lynda Learning) around, I certainly wasn’t aware of them at the time. But I had a Mac and there was plenty of documentation online detailing how to create your own app. At the time, Swift didn’t exist. It was all Objective-C, which I objectively hated. I’m not blaming the language or framework. Rather, I lacked the patience and wherewithal to truly immerse myself in it. So the iOS app remained a dream and nothing more.</p>
<p>As the years passed, I had fits and starts of trying to master the Webview frameworks: those that allow you to create a web app using Javascript and/or Typescript. Then, you click a button and, magically, an iOS and Android app are born from your code. Examples include Ionic, Phonegap, etc. These were definitely more in my wheelhouse, but getting the UI to appear and behave exactly the way I wanted by way of generating code was simply too much work.</p>
<p>Again, I have only myself to blame. I just lacked the time and mental fortitude to figure it all out. I mean: spending hours searching Stack Overflow in order to figure out how to get this button to appear in the correct way, hiding that control when focus was on such-and-such an input? And write tests for all this? I admire the thousands of developers out there who have mastered it all. There are truly some beautifully designed apps out there. But for me: forget it. I was built of weaker stuff.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the current moment: AI coding agents. Of course I had used Copilot in VS Code and had heard of the benefits of IDEs like Cursor, but nothing really drove me to try it all out. That is until past-me was smart enough to attend a tech talk at work introducing us all on how to leverage an agent to generate code for you at the project level.</p>
<p>I’m not talking about going into ChatGPT and asking it to create a function to sort some integers, or parse a date. Instead, I’m telling the agent: “You are a senior engineer in charge of designing an app that does x, y, and z. Generate 1-point stories for the project that junior engineers can use to create the app all the way to deploying it to production.”</p>
<p>Could I use this technique to create that iOS app I’ve been meaning to do all this time? It felt like cheating. Alot. I don’t know a lick of SwiftUI and I am not up on the latest iOS design specs and best practices. On the other hand, I also knew that life is short. This was something I really wanted to do. I concluded that as long as I was honest with myself and others about where my own human efforts ended and the AI-generated code started, then this was still a good effort and ought to be fun. And it was.</p>
<p>So I humbly introduce my first iOS app: Prime Number Finder. It’s a simple app that tells you if a number is prime or not. That’s it. Couldn’t have done it (at all) without Cursor and Claude, my two coding buddies.</p>
<p>If you’re curious, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-prime-number-finder/id6741829020">download</a> it from the App Store, try it out, and please leave any feedback, positive or negative. I’ve already started an <a href="https://github.com/ahl-gram/PrimeFinder/issues">issue list</a> in GitHub as there’s a lot more I’d like to add.</p>
<p>Oh, and this blog post is 100% written by me. Pinky swear. So, thank you for reading!</p>

			 <p>As a software engineering leader, my role often feels like a balancing act: juggling technical challenges, team dynamics, and quarterly objectives - all while trying to ensure the team feels supported, empowered, and safe. In the middle of all this, it’s easy to fall into the trap of wanting to fix every problem that comes my way. But what if the most impactful thing to do isn’t to fix anything at all, but to listen?</p>
<p>Active listening is a skill that transforms how you lead. It’s not just about hearing words, it’s about empathizing with the emotions, concerns, and ideas behind them. When listening, and <em>not</em> interrupting to offer a solution right away, you create a space where your team feels heard. This fosters trust, encourages collaboration, and improves morale. Oftentimes, the best ideas can come from the people closest to the problem.</p>
<p>Here’s the hard part: resist the urge to jump in and fix things. You got to listen to your team! As engineers, we’re hard-wired to solve problems, many times immediately. But when you offer solutions without listening to others' concerns, you risk shutting down creativity or making your team feel like their input isn’t valued. In other words, let them finish. When you feel it’s the right time to speak, try asking open-ended questions like, “what do you think the next step should be?” or “how can I support you in this?” This empowers your team and gives them confidence that they’re truly being heard.</p>
<p>Active listening also helps you uncover the root of issues. Sometimes, what seems like a technical problem is actually a communication gap, a misalignment of priorities, or even a personal challenge. By listening deeply, you can address the real problem, not just the symptoms. So, the next time a team member comes to you with a challenge, pause. Resist the urge to interrupt and fix. Listen with curiosity and empathy. You might be surprised at how much more effective, and connected, your leadership becomes.</p>

			 <p>🎂 🎂 🎂 Here we are: the big 5-oh. I asked ChatGPT to create a light but heartfelt post for me, but all I got out of that exercise was generic and saccharine outputs about how “50 is the new 30” (news to me), and how I’m looking forward to new adventures… blah blah blah. Plus, way too many birthday cake emojis.</p>
<p>Despite the milestone, it’s true that I’m feeling upbeat. I’m grateful for my beautiful family and life’s blessings. But the general tone of the ChatGPT responses - shockingly - reeked of AI. So I’m going to have to do this the hard way: write this post myself without the help of an AI assistant. Like an animal.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some perspective. Here’s some fun and interesting things that happened by the close of 1974:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nixon resigned as US president.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rubik’s Cube was invented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 closed at 68.56.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Dow closed at 616.24.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was born.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a funny line in “A Christmas Story” where Ralphie describes the feeling of time running out as “the Christmas noose beginning to tighten”. Turning 50 is kind of like that. My “time-left-to-do-stuff&quot; noose is beginning to tighten. Wait, that sounded darker than I intended. What I’m trying to say is that it’s a weird feeling knowing that I’m now older than my father was when I, as a kid, first realized he was OLD.</p>
<p>This being the age of electronic communication, I had a whole conversation with my extended family - over text - about how 50 is middle age (again, news to me). This is ridiculous given that the average lifespan in the US is around 80. The actuaries would say I’m well past middle-age. But I think the sentiment with my family was more complex than merely taking my expected lifespan and dividing it by two. Most of us, regardless of what the calendar says, feel like we’re perpetually in middle age. We’re constantly “adulting”: managing family, job, our homes, hobbies, our health, and unexpected life events.</p>
<p>Some of these unexpected life events can permanently change your perspective on your life. My wife’s cancer journey really drove that point home for me: Life is short. Yeah, no kidding. My advice: don’t just sit on your ass too long. Thing’s aren’t as good or as bad as you think.</p>
<p>Bill Burr said it best: “You’re gonna be fine. And even if you’re not, isn’t it better to exist thinking it’s going to be fine until it’s not? And then, you can handle it then. There’s no sense in ruining right now.”</p>
<p>Indeed. Enjoy right now. So, here’s to the next actuarially-adjusted 50 years.</p>
<p>Cheers and salud.</p>

Camille Fournier lays out the path in a way engineers and other tech workers will find easy to understand (trust me, if I was able to understand it, anyone can). I will be re-reading this again very soon. 👍🏻</p>

			 <p>A so-called financial columnist was recently scammed out of $50k in one of those &ldquo;shoe-box&rdquo; scams. There are entire YouTube channels dedicated to exposing this problem. The scam involves elaborate coordination across countries and continents. The complexity probably rivals that of some illegal drug organizations.</p>
<p>More here: <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/video/financial-columnist-speaks-after-losing-50k-scam-107359624">www.goodmorningamerica.com/living/vi&hellip;</a></p>
<p>3 things I&rsquo;d like to add to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I am NOT a financial nor a security expert. I am a person on the internet who merely has a passing interest in both subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please be very selective in who you take advice from, especially if they claim to be a &ldquo;journalist expert”. This is not meant to criticize journalists in general. Some of these people do amazing work, sometimes risking their lives. And many are indeed experts in money and finance. But it appears that, at least in this space, there is not enough accountability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please check on your family members who might not be very, er, &ldquo;tech savvy&rdquo;. Particularly elderly relatives. Elderly people in English-speaking countries are particularly easy targets for these types of scams.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Jake Kepins has a great summary over on Threads about the &ldquo;expert journalist&rdquo; as well. Worth the read.

			 <p>The selection of music on Apple Music compared to Spotify continues to disappoint. I already pay for the service via iCloud+. I have heard others describe the sound quality as being superior. I WANT to like it and use it. But until I can import my HIGHLY CURATED playlists from Spotify to Apple Music without a significant fraction of tracks being dropped on the floor, I will continue to use (and pay extra for) Spotify.</p>
